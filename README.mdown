# 🏛️ Virtual Museum

This project was developed as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction** course-assignment in my master's program.

It was built using **C# (.NET Framework)** and **SQLite**.

The entire project is using  **Greek** in its entire UI and navigation, as it was a university assignment.
